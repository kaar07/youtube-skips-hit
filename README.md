  # Youtube-SkipS-hit

  A firefox add-on to redirect youtube-recommendations page to youtube/feed/subscriptions.  
  To install to your browser (Mozilla Firefox) go to: [Youtube-SkipS-hit](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-skips-hit/).

  ### Note
  The set-up in this add-on is really no-brainer. However, I intend to improve on it.  
  If you can make better, do make pull request.
